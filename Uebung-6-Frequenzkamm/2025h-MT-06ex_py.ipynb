    "This exercise concerns the use of frequency combs for accurate frequency calibration in the context of precision spectroscopic measurements. The exercise is structured as follows: the first part refers to the general principle of locking a continuous-wave (cw) laser to a frequency comb, and how a beat-note signal between them can be observed and used for accurate frequency calibration. The second part is related to using the frequency comb in order to scan the frequency of the cw laser. We see how we can use this procedure to obtain a frequency-comb-calibrated, first-order-Doppler-compensated spectrum of a transition to a high Rydberg state in H$_2$, from which we can obtain accurate values for ionization energies in this fundamental system."

    "Frequency measurement methods based on the determination of wavelengths from interferometry (wavelength measurements) do not offer the accuracy required by precision spectroscopic determinations nowadays. Instead, a direct measurement (counting) of the frequency is desired. Whereas typical laser frequencies (e.g., $5\\times10^{14}$ Hz, corresponding to a wavelength of 600 nm) cannot be counted by electronic circuits, a frequency comb can be used in order to obtain a countable, low-frequency beat-note signal with the laser, from which an accurate value of the laser frequency ($f_{\\textrm{laser}}$) can be calculated.\n",
